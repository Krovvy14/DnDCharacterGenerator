The goal of this project is to randomly generate a lvl 1
D&D character.  This is going to take a few steps though.
    1. Randomly create a character.  This mans random classes, random races/sub-races where applicable, and random stats.
    2. Write this random data to the WotC D&D character sheet .pdf so you will be able to just run a script and have a character sheet at will
    3. Optimize the stats of your character based on the class
    4. Add spells, weapons, and armor and include their selection to the character creation process
